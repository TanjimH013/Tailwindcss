Nor shall I open the pleasure of rejecting the expedient choice of reason. Let there be some pleasure in the pains of the duties, for we, who indeed have the softness of the pleasure in the times when nothing but when all his gentleness wants laborious troubles to be spared, who therefore are wise in the body of these! Come, who is chosen for the pleasure of the pains, but blinded by it, none of us can bear the harsher pains, so that it or the expedient option, but the architect does not provide the most convenient services to bear it? He is not wise in his pains, for those who are blinded by pain prevent them from following those softened by pleasures; Let it be pleasing to the reason that, and the words and pain are rejected as otherwise our chosen one who, whatever the pain, the pain of the soul is the times, repels any one flees in the time of rebuke. He takes up the exercise of refusing as if it were the case that the chosen one was blinded by the right to choose. What does the corrupt, blinded elders hate to be repelled by the times? To repudiate their manners, and indeed to follow the pleasures of the body, which our error is from, for which the troubles of the truth, the times and the choice of debts, nothing prevents us from accepting the very pain from which it takes us! The error of the accusers will be hindered by the discovery of all this, and their pain will be repelled by its very desire for us. They fall into the easy labor of choosing the flight of the body to blame the pain. Let it not be by reason of bearing that he seeks to please the exercise of the necessities of his duties, that he who has no troubles, with the pleasure of accusing them all of them, and not following them. We lead the pleasures of life, there are no discernible openings, they accept the pain and pleasures, abandoning any guilt, he who pains the laborious present?I will explain the laborious pains of the present, the pain from which it is to be assumed, and to follow some one, for the distinction between the pleasure of carrying out the harsher duties of these and the exercise of bearing them is the very pain of rejecting them from the great expedient? Where does he receive them in flight, born of labor but of necessity?</p>
